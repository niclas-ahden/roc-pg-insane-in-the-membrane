## Integration tests of a single client against a real Postgres server.
##
## Normally run by ./tests.roc, which boots a throwaway server and passes its
## address here. To point it at your own server:
##
##     roc tests/integration.roc <host> <port> <user> <database>
##
## Note that the password auth test expects the pg_hba rule ./tests.roc
## installs, so it fails against a server that trusts every connection.
