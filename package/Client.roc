## A connection to a Postgres server.
##
## Open one with `Client.connect!`, passing the platform's `connect!` and its
## random numbers, which a SCRAM login needs. Everything after that goes
## through two methods of the stream `connect!` returns, `write!` and
## `read_exactly!`, each taking a timeout in milliseconds, as `Tcp.Stream`
## does on [basic-cli](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli):
##
## ```
## Db : Client.Client(Tcp.Stream, Schema)
##
## db = Client.connect!({
##     connect!: Tcp.connect!,
##     random_u64!: Random.seed_u64!,
##     host: "localhost",
##     port: 5432,
##     user: "postgres",
##     database: "postgres",
##     auth: Password(password),
## })?
##
## names : List({ name : Str })
## names = db.query!("select name from users where team_id = $team_id", { team_id, })?
## ```
##
## On [basic-webserver](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver), whose
## streams take no timeout, wrap its `connect!` in `Client.fixed_timeout`.
## The client is then a
## `Client.Client(Client.FixedTimeout(Tcp.Stream), Schema)`.
##
## `Schema` is the schema your queries are checked against (see [Catalog]),
## or [NoSchema] if you have none.
##
## The connection is plaintext for now, because neither
## [roc-lang/basic-cli](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli) nor
## [roc-lang/basic-webserver](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver)
## offers TLS on its TCP streams yet. This package will support TLS once a
## platform does. To reach a database on another machine until then, you
## can connect to a TLS proxy on this one, such as a
## [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org) that talks TLS to the database.
## `timeout_ms` limits each connect, read and write, not a whole query. See
## `Client.connect!` for the timeouts and for how the client logs in.
##
## The functions take the client first, so you call them as methods:
##
## - `Client.query!`, `Client.query_one!`, `Client.query_optional!` and
##   `Client.execute!` run queries that are checked when you build.
## - `Client.transaction!` runs several statements as one transaction.
## - `Client.query_unchecked!` and the other `_unchecked` functions run SQL
##   you build at runtime.
## - `Client.batch_execute_unchecked!` runs several statements separated by
##   `;`, such as a migration.
## - `Client.prepare_unchecked!` and `Client.command!` run prepared statements.
## - `Client.close!` ends the session.
##
## A client is one connection, and runs one query at a time. Never share
## one between code that runs at the same time, such as the handlers of a
## web server: their messages would interleave, and each could read the
## other's reply. Connect in each request instead. We recommend a
## [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org) on the same machine for that,
## since it keeps the connections to the database open, which makes
## connecting cheap.
##
## Every function names its errors with a type alias, such as
## [Client.CommandErr]. They are open tag unions, so `?` merges them into
## your own.
##
## - `PgErr(error)` means the server rejected the statement. The connection
##   can still be used, unless `error.severity` is `FATAL` or `PANIC`: the
##   server closes the connection after those.
## - `ContainsNul(what)` means the SQL, a statement name or a connection
##   setting holds a NUL byte, which the protocol cannot carry. Nothing was
##   sent.
## - `PgReadErr`, `PgWriteErr` and `PgProtoErr` mean the connection broke or
##   is in an unknown state. Don't use the client again, connect anew. The
##   platform closes the stream once nothing refers to it anymore.

	## Connect and authenticate. `connect!` is the platform's dial (`Tcp.connect!`)
	## and `random_u64!` its random numbers (`Random.seed_u64!`), for the nonce
	## of a SCRAM login. `auth` is `NoAuth` or `Password(str)`. The
	## server decides how the password is checked, and the client answers
	## SCRAM-SHA-256 (PostgreSQL 10 and later), md5 (any version) and
	## cleartext, the three methods PostgreSQL has for passwords. A dial the
	## platform refuses fails with `PgConnectErr(TcpConnectErr(err))`. See
	## [Client.StartupErr] for how a login fails.
	##
	## `auth_methods` is optional: the logins the client agrees to, named as
	## in pg_hba.conf:
	##
	## - `Scram`: SCRAM-SHA-256.
	## - `Md5`: an md5 hash of the password.
	## - `Cleartext`: the password itself (pg_hba's `password`).
	## - `Trust`: no login at all, the server lets the client in unasked.
	##
	## The server decides which it asks for. One it asks for that is not
	## listed fails with `AuthMethodNotAllowed(method)`. By default all four
	## are allowed. An app that knows how its server logs in says so, like
	## `auth_methods: [Md5]`. SCRAM draws its nonce from `random_u64!`. A
	## platform without random numbers can pass `|| Err(NoRandom)` and leave
	## `Scram` out.
	##
	## The connection is plaintext, the password included, so it is for a
	## server on the same machine, or on a network nobody else can reach. A
	## server that demands TLS refuses it.
	##
	## `params` is optional: extra run-time parameters for the session, such
	## as `("application_name", "my_app")` or `("search_path", "app,public")`.
	## Only session settings go there. The names the protocol keeps for
	## itself are refused with `ParamNotAllowed(name)`: `user` and `database`
	## (fields of their own here), `options` (settings written as command
	## line switches, which `params` already covers), `replication` (which
	## would switch the connection to the replication protocol) and any
	## name starting with `_pq_.`. So is `client_encoding`, which stays
	## `UTF8` because every string is read as UTF-8. Case does not matter,
	## as it does not for setting names.
	##
	## `statement_timeout_ms` is optional: how long a statement may run before
	## the server cancels it, which fails it with `PgErr` and SQLSTATE `57014`
	## and leaves the connection usable. Off by default, as in Postgres. It is
	## sent when the session starts, and one transaction can lift it with
	## `set local statement_timeout = 0`. [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org)
	## refuses startup parameters it does not know, so behind
	## [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org) set it on the role instead.
	##
	## `timeout_ms` is optional: how long the dial and each read or write may
	## wait. It is the backstop for a server or network that
	## stops answering, and must outlast the longest statement, because the
	## server sends nothing while one runs. By default 5 seconds more than
	## `statement_timeout_ms`, or 60 seconds without one. A job with longer
	## statements passes its own.
